/**
 * MASIS V3 — Multi-Timeframe Confluence Decision Engine.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED FROM V2, AND WHY
 *
 * V2 ran a single 1-minute series through a chain of heuristics and then voted
 * on direction by counting bullet points. Four structural problems came out of
 * that, and all four are addressed here:
 *
 *  1. ONE TIMEFRAME. Every read was 1-minute. At that resolution the EMA stack
 *     and "break of structure" flip many times an hour in tape that is going
 *     nowhere, so the engine emitted directional calls continuously regardless
 *     of whether a directional opportunity existed. V3 requires a higher
 *     timeframe to establish regime and bias before the lower timeframe is
 *     allowed to propose anything at all.
 *
 *  2. UNCONFIRMED BARS. V2 computed structure from the forming candle. Its
 *     break-of-structure test compared the live price against a rolling maximum
 *     that *included the current bar's own high*, so the test could essentially
 *     only pass on the exact tick that printed a new high — and every indicator
 *     downstream flickered intra-bar. V3 computes all structure from confirmed
 *     candles only; live price is used solely for entry distance and risk.
 *
 *  3. CORRELATED EVIDENCE COUNTED AS INDEPENDENT. "Price > VWAP", "EMA9 >
 *     EMA21" and "delta > 0" are three ways of saying price rose recently. V2
 *     needed three bullets to authorise a trade, so it authorised one the
 *     moment price ticked up — buying strength at highs with a stop under
 *     nothing. V3 replaces voting with named setups, each requiring a specific
 *     structural context and each carrying an invalidation level that exists on
 *     the chart.
 *
 *  4. A TRUST SCORE THAT WAS A CONSTANT. V2 built its score from four
 *     hard-coded numbers (85/85/90/70), so an authorised call always scored
 *     ~83 and the "minimum trust 65" filter downstream could never reject
 *     anything. V3's score is a weighted function of the actual evidence, and
 *     it is the same number the backtest reports, so the grades mean something
 *     measurable.
 *
 * The engine is deliberately biased toward NOT trading. Most of the time the
 * correct output is NO_TRADE, and saying so is the feature.

   * 0.15% / (stop distance as % of price) — so on 5-minute structure, where
   * stops land around 0.3-0.5%, fees eat 30-50% of every 1R the system earns.

   * logic on 15m structure, with proportionally wider stops, is roughly
   * break-even. Trading a faster timeframe with taker entries is not a tuning

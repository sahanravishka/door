## The question these answer

> *"What if we just call and profit a small amount and do it 100,000 times? Or
> just trading fees? Why can't we build an accurate prophet? Why can't we
> identify chaos first?"*

Three separate claims. One is arithmetically backwards, one is pointing at a
real mechanism, and one is the single best instinct in the question.

---

## 1. "Why can't we identify chaos first?"

**You can. Chaos is the predictable part. Direction isn't.**

Measured over 12,098 fifteen-minute bars per symbol:

| | lag 1 | lag 2 | lag 5 | lag 20 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| autocorrelation of **returns** (direction) | −0.009 | −0.009 | +0.010 | +0.003 |
| autocorrelation of **\|returns\|** (size) | **0.300** | **0.245** | **0.199** | **0.125** |

Direction is essentially independent from one bar to the next. Move *size* is
strongly dependent and decays slowly — volatility clustering, one of the most
robust findings in empirical finance. Regressing future realised volatility on
recent realised volatility gives **R² = 0.19–0.23**: roughly a fifth of future
volatility is explained by recent volatility alone.

Compare that to the direction-prediction ceiling on the same data:

| predictor | accuracy | avg captured |
|---|---|---|
| momentum (last bar) | 47.7–48.2% | −0.13 bps |
| **mean reversion (last 5)** | **52.2–53.6%** | **+0.14 to +0.26 bps** |
| always long | 49.2–49.9% | −0.02 bps |

The mean-reversion edge is *real* — 52–54% at n=12,098 is several standard
errors from chance, and the variance ratio confirms it (0.78–0.87 at 32 bars,
where 1.0 would be a random walk). It is simply worth about a quarter of a basis
point per trade.

So the prophet you want exists, but it forecasts the wrong quantity. It can tell
you *how violent* the next few hours will be with meaningful accuracy. It cannot
tell you which way.

---

## 2. "Do it 100,000 times"

The arithmetic is exact:

```
net = N × (edge_per_trade − cost_per_trade)
```

**Both terms scale with N.** Trade count is a multiplier on the per-trade
number, never a fix for it. Using the best measured edge (0.264 bps):

| fee structure | cost/round trip | net/trade | after 100,000 trades |
|---|---|---|---|
| retail taker | 11.0 bps | −10.74 bps | **−107% of stake** |
| retail maker | 4.0 bps | −3.74 bps | −37% |
| VIP-3 maker | 2.0 bps | −1.74 bps | −17% |
| MM rebate tier | −1.0 bps | +1.26 bps | +13% |

Repetition cannot change the sign of the per-trade number. If it is negative,
high frequency is the fastest known way to pay the exchange your entire account.
Only the rebate tier — which is gated on volume you do not have — turns positive,
and that is the mechanism, not the frequency, doing the work.

---

## 3. "Or just trading fees?" — market making

This half of the question is pointing at something real: as a taker you *pay*
the spread, as a maker you are *paid* it. The sign of the cost term genuinely
flips. So it was simulated properly.

A first-pass simulation produced +8.5 bps per fill at wide quotes, which was an
artefact of three things it did not model: it never closed the inventory, it
assumed touching a price meant filling at it, and it allowed unbounded one-sided
exposure. `passive-mm.js` models all three — queue penalty, forced unwinds at
the taker fee, inventory caps — and the result inverts:

| BTC, VIP-3 maker | 5 bps quote | 10 bps | 20 bps |
|---|---|---|---|
| net (bps, cumulative) | −12,945 | −2,433 | −1,074 |

Negative at every quote width, every fee tier below the rebate tier, and every
queue assumption tested (0 to 5 bps through). The killer is **adverse
selection**: a resting bid does not fill at random, it fills when someone wants
to sell, and often they want to sell because price is about to be lower.

Real market makers compete on inventory management, latency and fee tier — not
prediction. The gate is volume, not cleverness.

---

## 4. Getting paid without predicting — funding harvest

The one structure measured here whose payoff does not depend on being right
about direction. Long spot + short perp is delta neutral; price does whatever it
likes and the legs cancel. What does not cancel is the funding payment.

Measured over 33 days, 87 settlements:

| | BTC | ETH | SOL |
|---|---|---|---|
| mean funding per 8h | 0.0056% | 0.0056% | 0.0009% |
| settlements positive | 94% | 95% | 55% |
| gross annualised | 5.4% | 5.4% | 0.8% |
| **net of perp-leg fees** | **4.2%** | **4.2%** | −0.4% |

A counterintuitive result worth noting: the "smart" selective version — hold
only while funding is positive — **underperforms simply staying on**, because
each re-entry pays a round trip. On SOL it turns +2.4% gross into −17% net
across 16 re-entries. Cleverness costs money here.

Not modelled, and all of it reduces the number: spot-leg fees, entry basis,
liquidation risk on the short leg if it is levered, and exchange
counterparty risk, which in crypto is not a rounding error.

So: real, structural, non-directional — and about 4% a year. A yield, not a
windfall.

---

## 5. The finding that actually matters

Every losing result in this repository was dominated by the same term. Not the
signal. The **cost**.

The cost term is also the only quantity in the entire system under your direct
control. So it was tested: same signals, same bars, same risk sizing, same
position management — only the execution style changed.

| execution | trades | win % | expectancy | profit factor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **taker** (market in and out) | 66 | 42.4 | **−0.089R** | 0.78 |
| maker, limit at the touch | 66 | 45.5 | **+0.016R** | 1.04 |
| maker, limit 5 bps better | 63 | 49.2 | **+0.053R** | 1.14 |
| maker, limit 10 bps better | 59 | 47.5 | **+0.169R** | 1.44 |
| maker, limit 25 bps better | 44 | 47.7 | −0.075R | 0.83 |

**The strategy crosses from negative to positive on execution style alone.**
That is a swing of +0.10R to +0.26R per trade — larger than every signal
improvement achieved across the entire project combined, including the whole
analyst swarm.

The curve has a sensible interior shape rather than being monotonic: waiting for
a better price improves both the fee and the entry, until you start missing the
trades that never come back (22 of 66 missed at 25 bps). That is a real
trade-off, not a fitted parameter.

### Caveats, because this is the most important number here

- **n = 44–66.** The ranking is consistent across every setting, but the peak at
  10 bps is not distinguishable from the touch case at this sample size. The
  honest claim is "maker beats taker decisively", not "10 bps is optimal".
- **Fill modelling is optimistic.** A limit fills here if price trades through
  it. Real queue position means you may not fill at all. The 25 bps row shows
  what missed fills cost.
- **Stops stay market orders.** A stop that waits for a maker fill is not a stop.
  Only entries and take-profits become passive, which is why the improvement is
  roughly half the full maker/taker spread rather than all of it.

---

## The alien answer

An alien looking at this would not ask how to predict the number better. It
would notice that you are trying to forecast a quantity that thousands of
better-capitalised, lower-latency, lower-fee actors are also forecasting, where
the act of forecasting changes it — and then ask what *else* in the system is
predictable, uncompeted, or structurally paid.

The answers it would find, in descending order of how much they are worth to you:

1. **Your own cost basis.** Uncompeted, fully under your control, and worth more
   than every signal in this repository combined. Measured: +0.10 to +0.26R per
   trade.
2. **Volatility.** Genuinely forecastable (R² ≈ 0.2) while direction is not. Use
   it to size positions and to decide *when* to be active, not what to buy.
3. **Funding.** A structural payment for providing leverage to people who want
   it more than you do. ~4%/yr, delta-neutral, boring, real.
4. **Direction.** Real but worth ~0.25 bps, against a cheapest-possible round
   trip of 2 bps. This is the thing everyone spends their time on, and it is the
   only item on this list where the edge is smaller than the cost of acting on it.

The loophole was never a better prophet. It was noticing that the house takes a
cut on every prediction, and that the cut is bigger than the prophecy is worth.

# Part II — Attacking the data

The brief for this round was: stop re-examining the system, go after the data
itself, look for what *isn't* being looked at, and don't believe anything —
attack it.

```bash
node research/anomaly-scan.js --tf 15 --horizon 4   # 126 hypotheses, FDR-controlled
node research/forced-flow.js --tf 15                # liquidation-cascade reversion
node research/volatility-harvest.js --tf 15         # bet on magnitude, not direction
```

## The result, stated first

**Nothing survived.** 126 calendar and market-state hypotheses, a causally
motivated forced-flow hypothesis, and a strategy built specifically around the
one quantity Study 1 proved to be forecastable. Across all of it, zero findings
cleared the bar.

That is not a failed search. It is a measured answer to "is there something
obvious nobody is looking at", and the answer on this data is no. What follows
is how that conclusion was reached, because the method matters more than the
verdict.

## How the scan nearly fooled us — twice

**First trap: multiple testing.** Test 126 slices at the 5% level and about 6
will look significant when nothing is there. The scan therefore applies
Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control across all tests jointly.

**Second trap: overlapping windows, and this one did fool me.** The first run
of the scan reported **18 survivors**, several with effect sizes of 6–14 bps,
including a +14.29 bps anomaly at 14:00 UTC on ETH that also appeared on SOL —
cross-symbol confirmation, which is normally strong evidence.

It was an artefact of my own error. A 4-bar forward return, sampled at every
bar, means consecutive observations share 3 of their 4 forward bars. They are
heavily autocorrelated, the naive standard error is far too small, and every
t-statistic comes out inflated. Adding Newey-West HAC standard errors removed a
median inflation of **1.44×** — and took the survivor count from 18 to **zero**.

Every single one of those 18 "discoveries" was noise wearing a p-value.

## Third trap: not enough data, which the data itself revealed

The scan was first run on 126 days, then on 418 days. Watch what happened to the
families that looked most promising:

| family | median \|t\| on 126 days | median \|t\| on 418 days |
|---|---|---|
| runs | 1.42 | **0.26** |
| volstate | 1.95 | **1.36** |
| location | 1.05 | 0.65 |
| hour | 0.83 | 0.85 |

Under a true null, median |t| sits near 0.67. The `runs` family collapsed from
1.42 to 0.26 when given more data. That is precisely what noise does, and it is
the cleanest demonstration in this repository that the method is working.

## Forced flow — a good hypothesis that didn't hold

The strongest *causal* idea tested: a liquidation is not a decision. When a
leveraged position crosses maintenance margin the exchange closes it at market,
at any price. That order is completely price-insensitive — the only flow in the
market with a mechanical reason to overshoot. If it overshoots mechanically, it
should revert mechanically.

Detected from bars via the cascade signature (outsized move against recent
volatility, extreme volume, long rejection wick, close back from the extreme),
tested at three severity thresholds and four horizons:

- On 126 days of SOL, the severe filter gave **+13.85 bps at a 1-bar horizon**,
  consistent across both halves (+12.6 / +15.0). Promising.
- On 418 days of BTC, the same filter gives **−5.64 bps**. Opposite sign.
- The largest effect found (BTC, severe, 48 bars, +18.58 bps, t=1.94) splits
  +40.7 in the first half and −3.9 in the second.

Signs disagree across symbols and across halves. The causal story is sound; the
effect is not measurable at these thresholds on this data.

## Betting on magnitude instead of direction

The logical conclusion of Study 1: if direction is unpredictable and magnitude
is predictable, stop betting on direction. The structure that expresses that
without options is a two-sided breakout bracket — a buy stop above the coil and
a sell stop below, so whichever way the expansion goes, you are in it.

| BTC, 418 days | n | mean bps | t (HAC) | win % | 1st half | 2nd half |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| coil 8, all | 4,714 | −3.16 | **−2.04** | 49% | −2.0 | −4.3 |
| coil 16, all | 2,351 | +2.47 | 0.80 | 51% | +2.8 | +2.2 |
| coil 32, all | 1,189 | +7.28 | 1.21 | 52% | +2.7 | +11.8 |
| coil 32, quietest 25% | 301 | +5.18 | 0.81 | 58% | +7.4 | +2.8 |

The only result reaching |t| > 2 is **negative**: fast breakouts on short coils
lose reliably. There is a visible gradient — longer coils and tighter
compression give higher win rates (58%) and positive means — but no t-statistic
reaches significance, so it stays a gradient, not a finding.

## What "nothing survived" is worth

Three things.

**One: it cost almost nothing to find out.** Each of these is a few hundred
lines. The alternative — trading them and finding out — is how the V2 system
lost 49–70%.

**Two: the anomalies that got killed are exactly the ones people trade.**
Hour-of-day patterns, day-of-week effects, fading big moves, fading streaks,
buying compression breakouts, fading volume spikes. All of them produce
convincing-looking numbers on a few months of data. None survived 418 days plus
correct standard errors.

**Three: it sharpens where the edge actually was.** After attacking the data
this hard and finding nothing, the finding from Part I is still standing:

> Changing execution from taker to maker moved the existing strategy from
> −0.089R to +0.016R… +0.169R per trade.

That was never a prediction. It was the cost term — the one quantity not
competed over, because it isn't a forecast at all. Every hypothesis in Part II
was an attempt to out-predict a market; the one thing that worked was declining
to pay 11 bps for the privilege.

## What would be worth attacking next

Ranked by the chance there is something there that this data cannot see:

1. **Order book data.** Everything here is OHLCV plus hourly derivatives. Queue
   dynamics, depth imbalance and iceberg behaviour live in the book, are not
   reconstructable from bars, and are where the shortest-horizon edges are.
   This is the largest genuine blind spot.
2. **Cross-exchange.** One venue was measured. Lead-lag, basis and funding
   differentials between venues are mechanical, and unlike direction they do not
   require anyone to be wrong.
3. **Liquidation feeds.** Exchanges publish actual liquidation prints. Study 6
   inferred cascades from bar shape, which is a lossy proxy for an event that is
   directly observable.
4. **Longer history.** 418 days covers roughly one regime. A seasonality claim
   needs years, and the 126-vs-418-day comparison above shows exactly how much
   a short sample can lie.

And a rule earned the hard way: any future candidate goes through the same four
gates — HAC standard errors, FDR correction across everything tested, both
halves of the sample, and an effect larger than the cost of trading it. The 18
anomalies that failed those gates would all have looked like discoveries.

# Correction to Part I — the maker finding, re-measured on 418 days

Part I reported that switching execution from taker to maker moved the strategy
from **−0.089R to +0.016R … +0.169R** per trade, and called that "crossing from
losing to profitable". That was measured on 126 days and 44–66 trades.

Re-run on 418 days, with 244 trades:

| execution | n (126d) | expectancy (126d) | n (418d) | **expectancy (418d)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| taker | 66 | −0.089R | 244 | **−0.137R** |
| maker, at the touch | 66 | +0.016R | 244 | **−0.057R** |
| maker, 10 bps better | 59 | +0.169R | 222 | **+0.000R** |

Two things to take from this, and they point in opposite directions.

**The relative finding got stronger.** The gap between taker and maker execution
is **+0.137R per trade**, now measured across 244 trades rather than 66. Every
rung of the ladder improves monotonically, and the mechanism is arithmetic
rather than fitted. That part holds.

**The absolute claim did not.** "Crosses into profitable" was a small-sample
artefact. On 3.3× the data the best execution lands at **exactly break-even**,
not at +0.169R. The strategy is not profitable; it is merely no longer paying
for the privilege of trading.

This is the same lesson the anomaly scan taught, arriving from the other
direction, and it applies to my own headline result as readily as to anyone
else's: **an effect measured on a few dozen trades will shrink when you give it
more data.** The honest summary of the whole project is therefore:

- V2 was decisively losing (−0.335R over 1,051 trades) for identifiable,
  fixed structural reasons.
- V3 with taker execution is still losing, −0.137R over 244 trades.
- V3 with maker execution is break-even, ±0 over 222 trades.
- No anomaly search, analyst swarm, or signal improvement moved it past that.

Getting to break-even from −0.335R is real progress and it came almost entirely
from removing defects and costs rather than from adding prediction. Getting from
break-even to profitable is a different problem, and nothing measured here
solves it yet.

---

# Part III — Attacking everything

Four remaining blind spots, attacked. One produced the clearest result in the
whole project.

```bash
node research/fetch-extra.js daily BTC-USDT-SWAP,ETH-USDT-SWAP,SOL-USDT-SWAP
node research/fetch-extra.js index BTC-USDT,ETH-USDT,SOL-USDT
node research/fetch-extra.js spot BTC,ETH,SOL,AVAX,LINK,DOGE
node research/seasonality-multiyear.js    # calendar, 5-7 years of daily bars
node research/basis-convergence.js        # perp vs its own index
node research/cross-venue.js              # OKX perp vs Coinbase spot
node research/collect-orderbook.js        # the blind spot that needs time, not code
```

## The headline

**A large, unambiguously real inefficiency was found. It is unreachable.**

Cross-venue dislocation between OKX perpetuals and Coinbase spot reverts with
t-statistics up to **38**, on thousands of observations, surviving every gate.
On DOGE the p99 dislocation is **11.31 bps** — comfortably above any plausible
cost.

Then the execution-lag test:

| symbol | reversion measured at the close | reversion available at the NEXT bar's open |
|---|---|---|
| BTC | +0.45 bps | −0.05 bps |
| ETH | +1.15 bps | +0.02 bps |
| SOL | +2.32 bps | +0.19 bps |
| AVAX | +9.44 bps | +0.04 bps |
| **DOGE** | **+11.31 bps** | **−0.60 bps** |

**The entire dislocation closes inside the one minute between seeing it and
being able to act on it.** Not most of it. All of it, and on DOGE slightly past
zero. This is what a competitive market looks like from the inside: not an
absence of inefficiency, but an inefficiency that exists only in the interval
you cannot reach.

## Attack 1 — Perpetual basis

The most mechanically forced quantity available. Funding is a literal
negative-feedback controller wired into the contract: when the perp trades above
its index, longs pay shorts, in proportion to the gap. This needs nobody to be
wrong.

It works, overwhelmingly. Fading an extreme basis as a spread (long one leg,
short the other) is significant at **t up to 44.8**, p-values past 1e-300, on
8,000 observations. 19 of 24 tests survive FDR.

And the effect is **0.5–2.3 bps** against a two-leg cost floor of 2 bps. All but
one land below it.

The directional version — does an extreme basis predict the perp's own return —
is **not significant anywhere**. The mechanical part works exactly as the
contract specifies, and contributes nothing beyond that.

## Attack 2 — Calendar effects over 5–7 years

The earlier scan tested hour-of-day and weekday on 418 days. This used 2,000+
daily bars per instrument, back to 2019.

The first run found ETH in July at **+74.7 bps/day, t=3.20**, consistent across
both halves. It survived FDR. It looked like a genuine seasonal.

It was wrong, for two reasons I had to fix in my own test:

1. **It was measured against zero, not against the drift.** Crypto rose over the
   period (+19 bps/day for ETH). Any subset of a rising series has a positive
   mean. The question worth asking is whether July differs from an *ordinary
   day*, so the series must be demeaned first.
2. **The independent unit for a monthly effect is a year, not a day.** Reporting
   n=217 for "July" is misleading — those are 7 Julys, and days inside one July
   share a regime almost entirely. The honest sample size is 7.

With both corrected: **nothing survives**, and monthly effects become untestable
at all — 5–7 independent observations cannot support the claim. Family median
|t| collapses to 0.64 / 0.51 / 0.28 against a null expectation of 0.67. Textbook
null behaviour.

## Attack 3 — Cross-venue

Detailed above. Two further points worth keeping.

**The dislocation is the size of the cost of closing it.** Measured against live
top-of-book spreads:

| symbol | spot spread | perp spread | combined | p99 dislocation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BTC | 0.00 | 0.01 | 0.01 | 0.45 |
| ETH | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.08 | 1.15 |
| SOL | 0.98 | 0.98 | 1.96 | 2.32 |
| AVAX | 2.68 | 1.34 | 4.02 | 9.44 |
| DOGE | 3.56 | 1.19 | 4.75 | 11.31 |

Across a 25× range of liquidity, the gap tracks the cost of removing it. That is
arbitrageurs competing until what remains is exactly their own friction.

**I had to kill an artefact first.** A thin venue's 1-minute bar may contain no
trades, making its close stale. Comparing a live price against a stale one
manufactures a gap that "reverts" the moment the thin venue prints — and
staleness rises as liquidity falls, which would generate this exact gradient
fraudulently. Filtering every bar with zero volume or an unchanged close (7–9%
of bars on the thin names) left the effect **slightly stronger**. The artefact
explanation is dead; the execution-lag one is what killed it.

**Lead-lag is zero.** Cross-venue return correlations at 1–3 minute lags are
0.01–0.04 in both directions, against a contemporaneous correlation of 0.99.
Neither venue leads the other at any resolution this data can see.

## Attack 4 — Order book and liquidations

This one could not be attacked, and the reason is worth stating precisely rather
than dressed up.

- **Order books are served live only.** No exchange offers historical depth via
  public API. Nothing about queue position, depth imbalance, or genuine
  spoofing is reconstructable from bars.
- **OKX's liquidation feed returns ~100 events**, roughly three hours, and
  backward pagination does not work. The fetcher was written and run; it
  retrieved 100 prints spanning 0.13 days per symbol. That cannot support an
  event study.

So `collect-orderbook.js` records both going forward — top-of-book depth,
imbalance at 5 and 25 levels, and liquidation prints — to newline-delimited
JSON. It needs to run for weeks before the questions become answerable. That is
a waiting problem, not a coding one, and this is the largest genuinely
unexplored area left.

## What all of this adds up to

Every real effect found across three rounds of attacking has the same shape:

| effect | statistically real? | large enough to trade? | reachable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| mean reversion (15m) | yes, ~5 SE | no, 0.26 bps vs 2 bps floor | yes |
| basis convergence | yes, t up to 44.8 | mostly no, 0.5–2.3 bps | yes |
| cross-venue dislocation | yes, t up to 38 | **yes, up to 11.3 bps** | **no — closes in <1 min** |
| calendar effects | no | — | — |
| forced-flow reversion | no | — | — |
| volatility breakout | no | — | — |

Nothing here is hidden. Everything is measurable with public data and a few
hundred lines. And each one is sealed — by cost, by speed, or by not existing.
That is not a discouraging finding, it is a specific one: it says the remaining
levers are **cost, speed, and access**, not insight. Which is where Part I
landed from the opposite direction, and why the execution change remains the
only thing in this repository that moved the number.

---

# Part IV — "We always land at 41-47%. What if we do the opposite?"

Three studies, answering the question directly.

```bash
node research/winrate-frontier.js --tf 15 --cost 15    # is win rate a free parameter?
node research/indicator-grid.js  --tf 15 --cost 15     # 2,448 configurations
```

## The 41-47% is not a signal problem. It is 50% minus the fee.

The grid ran **2,448 strategy configurations** — 10 custom indicators × 2-3
parameters each × 3 thresholds × momentum *and* reversion × 6 holding periods ×
6 symbols. Here is the single most important table it produced:

| holding period | configs | **gross win %** | **net win %** | mean bps |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 15 min | 408 | **49.7%** | **25.0%** | −15.00 |
| 30 min | 408 | **49.8%** | 30.6% | −15.00 |
| 60 min | 408 | **49.8%** | 35.3% | −15.00 |
| 4 hours | 408 | **49.9%** | 41.7% | −15.00 |
| 12 hours | 408 | **50.0%** | 45.6% | −15.00 |
| 24 hours | 408 | **50.0%** | 47.2% | −15.00 |

**Gross win rate is 49.7-50.0% at every horizon.** Flat. Across every indicator,
every parameter, every threshold, both directions. The indicators have no
directional edge at any holding period — before costs, all of it is a coin flip.

**Net win rate climbs from 25% to 47%** as the hold lengthens. That entire climb
is cost dilution: the fee is fixed per trade while the expected move grows with
time, so a shorter hold has a larger share of its trades converted from winner
to loser by the fee. At 15 minutes, the fee flips a quarter of all trades.

So the 41-47% that keeps appearing is not the strategy failing to predict. It is
**50% minus what the exchange takes.** That is why it appears no matter what
indicator is used.

## Can we get 53-59%? Yes, trivially, and it does not help

`winrate-frontier.js` takes **random coin-flip entries** on BTC and changes only
the target/stop ratio:

| target : stop | win rate | gross expectancy | net expectancy |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.25 : 1 | **80.0%** | +0.002 | −0.229 |
| 0.5 : 1 | **66.5%** | +0.002 | −0.229 |
| 1 : 1 | 50.2% | +0.005 | −0.225 |
| 2 : 1 | 37.2% | +0.018 | −0.212 |
| 3 : 1 | 33.1% | +0.017 | −0.214 |

An 80% win rate, on **no information whatsoever**, by putting the target at a
quarter of the stop distance. Gross expectancy stays pinned at zero across the
entire sweep, because moving the target trades win *rate* against win *size* at
a fixed exchange rate. There is nothing to manufacture expectancy from.

Across the 2,448-configuration grid, the **correlation between win rate and
expectancy is 0.036**. Effectively zero. The top 12 configurations by win rate
and the top 12 by expectancy share almost no members.

**Win rate is a dial. Expectancy is the score.**

## Does inverting a losing strategy make it a winning one?

No, and the reason is arithmetic: **Net = Gross − Cost.** Inverting flips the
sign of Gross. It does not flip Cost, because you pay the spread and the fee in
both directions.

Every rule run forwards and inverted on identical bars:

| rule | win% | exp R | inverted win% | inverted exp R | gross R |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| momentum, last bar | 36.8% | −0.162 | 37.3% | −0.154 | +0.005 |
| momentum, 5-bar | 37.6% | −0.142 | 36.5% | −0.175 | +0.025 |
| reversion, last bar | 37.3% | −0.154 | 36.8% | −0.162 | +0.013 |
| above/below 20-EMA | 37.0% | −0.156 | 37.1% | −0.161 | +0.012 |
| 20-bar breakout | 37.6% | −0.131 | 36.0% | −0.187 | +0.047 |

Both columns lose. The "gross R" column — the same rule with costs switched off
— is where the rules actually sit: between +0.005 and +0.047, i.e. nothing.
There is no negative edge to invert into a positive one. There is a zero edge
and a fee.

Inverting a strategy that loses to *costs* gives you a strategy that also loses
to costs. You do not get −(−0.137R). You get −(Gross) − Cost.

## After correcting for the size of the search

2,181 of the 2,448 configurations passed FDR correction — because they are
reliably, significantly **negative**. Of everything that passed:

> **0 are positive and hold their sign across both halves of the sample.**

Not one, out of 2,448 combinations of indicator, parameter, threshold,
direction, holding period and symbol.

## What this actually leaves

The three studies agree on the same mechanism from three directions:

1. Gross edge is ~0 at every horizon tested, for every indicator tested.
2. Win rate is set by the target/stop ratio, not by skill, and is uncorrelated
   with profitability (r = 0.036).
3. The observed 41-47% is 50% minus the fee, which is why it is so stable.

Which means there are exactly two levers that demonstrably move the number, and
neither is a signal:

- **Hold longer.** Not because prediction improves — gross win rate is 50.0% at
  24 hours just as it is at 15 minutes — but because the fixed fee becomes a
  smaller share of a larger move. Net win rate goes 25% → 47% on that alone.
- **Pay less.** The maker/taker result from Part I, worth +0.137R per trade.

Both shrink the cost term. Nothing found in three rounds of searching grows the
gross term.

# Part V — Patience at the entry

A fair challenge: every study up to here, including the 2,448-configuration
grid, entered **at market on the signal bar**. The holding period varied; the
entry never did. That is one narrow scenario tested many times.

```bash
node research/patient-entry.js --tf 15 --hold 48 --wait 8
```

Waiting before entering does two separate things, and they had to be measured
apart because only one of them would be new:

1. **It lowers cost.** A resting limit pays maker instead of taker and does not
   cross the spread. Already known, worth about +0.137R per trade.
2. **It selects which trades you get.** A limit below the market only fills if
   price comes back — so you systematically miss the trades that ran away
   immediately. That is a *filter on the population of trades*, and unlike a
   fee, a filter can change **gross** expectancy.

So gross is reported next to net everywhere. That comparison is the study.

## The answer

| entry method | mean **GROSS** bps | vs instant | mean **NET** bps | vs instant | fill rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| INSTANT (market) | −0.70 | — | −15.70 | — | 100% |
| delay 1 bar | −0.40 | +0.30 | −15.40 | +0.30 | 100% |
| delay 4 bars | −0.58 | +0.12 | −15.58 | +0.12 | 100% |
| limit 5 bps better | −1.19 | −0.49 | −3.19 | **+12.51** | 93% |
| limit 15 bps better | −0.57 | **+0.12** | −2.57 | **+13.12** | 81% |
| limit 40 bps better | −1.57 | −0.87 | −3.57 | **+12.13** | 54% |
| pullback 25% of move | −3.35 | −2.66 | −5.35 | **+10.34** | 67% |
| pullback 50% of move | −1.30 | −0.61 | −3.30 | **+12.39** | 41% |

**Gross does not move.** The column wobbles between −2.66 and +0.30 — noise
around zero, with no relationship to how patient the entry is. Waiting for a
better price does **not** select better trades. The ones you miss were not
systematically the good ones.

**Net improves by +10 to +13 bps** — and the taker/maker difference is 13 bps.
Patience is worth exactly the fee saving, to the basis point, and nothing more.

Even the most extreme filter tested — waiting for a 50% retracement, which
discards 59% of all signals — leaves gross unchanged. Throwing away most of the
trades does not improve the ones you keep.

## What it does do for win rate

| | win rate |
|---|---|
| instant, taker | 43.1% |
| limit 15 bps better, maker | 47.8% |
| limit 40 bps better, maker | **48.4%** |

Patient entry raises the win rate ~5 points, and on the mean-reverting signals it
reaches **51.9-52.1%**. That is the honest route to a higher win rate — but note
what produced it: not better prediction, just fewer trades being flipped from
winner to loser by the fee. Same mechanism as holding longer, from Part IV.

## After correction

28 signal × entry-method combinations, FDR at q=0.10: 12 pass, and

> **0 are positive and stable across both halves.**

Consistent with everything before it.

## Where this leaves the entry question

Patient limit entry is **worth doing** — it is the single largest improvement
available, it moves net expectancy by +13 bps, and it takes a losing
configuration to approximately break-even (net −0.34 to +0.68 bps on the
reverting signals, versus −13 to −20 instant).

But it is worth doing for the boring reason. It is a rebate, not an insight.
Gross expectancy was zero before the wait and is zero after it, which is now the
fourth independent route to the same conclusion:

- holding longer: gross flat at 50.0% win, net improves (Part IV)
- inverting: gross flips a number that is already zero (Part IV)
- patient entry: gross flat, net improves by exactly the fee (Part V)
- maker vs taker execution: +0.137R per trade (Part I)

Every lever that has ever moved the number in this repository moved the **cost**
term. Nothing has moved the **gross** term, across 2,448 indicator
configurations, 126 market-state slices, 69 calendar hypotheses, four
cross-venue and basis structures, and now 28 entry methods.

# Part VI — "Build advanced indicators, not MA and RSI"

The challenge: it's a binary outcome — up or down in 15/30/60 minutes. It's the
result of a million causes. Can we identify those causes, build genuinely
advanced indicators, and find the moments where the answer is knowable? And five
well-calculated trades would be enough — I don't need a hundred.

**The first half of that was right, and it exposed a real flaw in my own work.**

## The flaw: 2,448 tests of ~2 things

Study 11 measured the information content of the indicator set the grid used.
Eight "different" indicators, correlation matrix:

| | roc14 | rsi14 | boll20 | donch20 | emaX12 | eff30 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| roc_14 | 1.00 | **0.99** | 0.80 | 0.80 | 0.60 | 0.63 |
| bollinger_20 | 0.80 | 0.82 | 1.00 | **0.94** | 0.50 | 0.59 |
| emaCross_12 | 0.60 | 0.61 | 0.50 | 0.54 | 1.00 | **0.91** |

RSI and rate-of-change correlate **0.99**. Bollinger and Donchian **0.94**. EMA
cross and efficiency ratio **0.91**.

**Effective rank: 2.42 out of 8.**

So the 2,448-configuration grid was not 2,448 independent attempts at
prediction. It was roughly 2.4 dimensions of information, tested 2,448 ways.
That is much weaker evidence than it appeared, and the criticism lands.

**Adding a cleverer price formula cannot help.** No transform of a series adds
information the series does not contain. That is not a market fact, it is an
arithmetic one.

## So new information was added

Open interest, funding, crowd long/short positioning, measured taker flow, and
cross-venue basis — five sources that are not functions of the price series.

| feature set | effective rank |
|---|---|
| 8 price indicators | 2.47 |
| + 5 non-price sources | **5.19** |

And each new source is genuinely orthogonal to the price block:

| non-price feature | max \|corr\| with ANY price indicator |
|---|---|
| crowd long/short ratio | 0.064 |
| cross-venue basis | 0.087 |
| funding z-score | 0.125 |
| open-interest change | 0.240 |
| taker imbalance | 0.299 |

The information content more than doubled. This is exactly the "advanced
indicators" the question asked for — not new arithmetic, new measurements.

## Then it was tested, walk-forward

Ridge-regularised, strictly walk-forward, standardised on training statistics
only, refit as the window rolls. 1,518 out-of-sample forecasts per symbol.

| symbol | feature set | accuracy | **IC** | net bps |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BTC | price only (2.4 dims) | 49.9% | −0.044 | −3.97 |
| BTC | **price + derivatives (5.2 dims)** | 49.7% | −0.052 | −4.19 |
| ETH | price only | 50.1% | −0.052 | −3.70 |
| ETH | **price + derivatives** | 49.1% | −0.033 | −4.44 |
| SOL | price only | 50.1% | +0.026 | −2.52 |
| SOL | **price + derivatives** | 48.9% | +0.030 | −4.22 |

Doubling the information content changed nothing. IC — the correlation between
forecast and outcome — sits between −0.052 and +0.030 across every combination.
A good systematic equity signal runs an IC of 0.02–0.05; this is indistinguishable
from zero in both directions.

## And the "five well-calculated trades" test

This deserved its own test, because a model can be useless on average and still
be right where it is most confident. Restricting to the strongest forecasts:

| confidence slice | BTC | ETH | SOL |
|---|---|---|---|
| all 1,518 forecasts | 49.7% | 49.1% | 48.9% |
| strongest 10% (n=151) | **34.4%** | 47.0% | 56.3% |
| strongest 2% (n=30) | **26.7%** | 46.7% | **40.0%** |

**Accuracy gets worse as confidence rises.** On BTC the model's most confident
forecasts are right 26.7% of the time — it is reliably, strongly wrong exactly
where it is most sure.

That is the specific answer to "five well-calculated trades is enough". There is
no high-conviction subset to select. The model has no region where it knows
more; its confidence is anti-correlated with its accuracy. Five trades chosen
this way would be five trades chosen from its worst-performing region.

(The SOL 56.3% at n=151 is the sort of lone positive cell this whole project has
learned to distrust — it collapses to 40.0% at the next slice down.)

## What is honestly still open

This is a negative result on **thin data**, and that limit should be stated
plainly rather than buried:

- **The derivatives history is 30 days.** OKX retains only 720 hourly rows, which
  yields ~2,758 aligned observations and 1,518 out-of-sample forecasts. That is
  enough to rule out a large effect, not a small one. Years of open-interest and
  funding history would make this a real test rather than an indication.
- **The five sources are the ones that happen to be free.** Order book depth,
  liquidation prints, options positioning, on-chain flows and stablecoin
  issuance are all genuinely orthogonal information that was not available here.
  The collector in `collect-orderbook.js` exists precisely because that is the
  largest reachable gap.
- **A linear model was used.** A non-linear one could find interactions a ridge
  regression cannot. With 2,758 rows and 13 features that would mostly fit
  noise, so it was not attempted — but with years of data it would be the
  obvious next step.

So the correct summary is not "this is impossible". It is: **the information
that was reachable here, combined properly and tested honestly, does not
forecast 15-to-60-minute direction — and the model's own confidence is not a
guide to when it does.**

The premise of the question was right. Better formulas on the same data cannot
work, and new information is the only path. That path was taken as far as the
available data allows, and it stopped here.

# Part VII — Equations from outside technical analysis

The challenge here was specific: stop rearranging price into new indicator
shapes, and instead bring in mathematics from a field that isn't technical
analysis — the kind a market microstructure researcher or an information
theorist would reach for.

```bash
node research/novel-equations.js --tf 15 --cost 4
```

Three were implemented, each a real, named equation from a different
discipline, none a variant of anything in Part VI:

## 1. Kyle's Lambda (market microstructure, Kyle 1985)

The canonical price-impact equation: regress price change on signed order flow
over a trailing window. The slope, λ, is literally "how much does it cost in
price to push this much size" — the founding equation of market microstructure
theory, built from the same real taker-flow data Part VI used, not from price
alone.

Tested both directions — does an impact spike predict reversion (an
informationally-driven overshoot) or continuation (informed flow that keeps
being right) — at 2 horizons on 3 symbols, 728/609/756 extreme events:

Every configuration failed. One reaches conventional significance before
correction (BTC, follow, 4 bars, t=−2.61) — and it's negative and unstable
(+1.1 second half vs −7.8 first). Nothing survives FDR.

## 2. Jump / continuous decomposition (Barndorff-Nielsen & Shephard, 2004)

Realised variance mixes two different underlying stochastic processes —
continuous diffusion and discontinuous jumps. Bipower variation (the product of
adjacent absolute returns, correctly rescaled) estimates the continuous part
alone; realised variance minus that isolates the jump component. This is
mathematically distinct from "big candle" detection: it's asking which
*process* generated the move, not how large it was.

First pass was starved — only 30 days of derivatives-aligned data gave BTC 92
events and ETH/SOL too few to test at all. The equation itself needs only
price, so it got a fair rerun on the full 418-day series: **1,742 events** at
the loosest threshold.

| symbol | thresh | mode | hold | n | mean bps | t(HAC) | 1st half | 2nd half |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ETH | 0.6 | fade | 48b | 380 | **−22.18** | **−2.98** | −14.5 | −25.3 |
| BTC | 0.4 | fade | 16b | 1560 | −8.09 | −3.32 | −7.7 | −8.2 |
| ETH | 0.5 | fade | 16b | 757 | −11.77 | −3.29 | −14.0 | −10.4 |

FDR across 54 configurations: **13 survive — all negative.** Fading a jump
loses reliably; following one doesn't reliably win either (t stays under 2
everywhere in that direction). **Zero positive and stable across both halves.**
The equation is real and now well-powered; the market doesn't reward trading it
in either direction after cost.

## 3. Transfer entropy (information theory, Schreiber 2000)

Correlation only sees linear dependence. Transfer entropy measures how much
uncertainty about price's future is resolved by another series' past, beyond
what price's own past already resolves — including non-linear, non-monotonic
dependence that Part VI's correlation-based effective-rank calculation is
structurally blind to. Significance via a 200-fold permutation test (the
correct null for this statistic, no normality assumption).

| symbol | source | TE observed | null mean | z | perm p |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BTC | signed order flow | 0.0009 | 0.0020 | −1.08 | 0.900 |
| BTC | open interest | 0.0007 | 0.0019 | −1.40 | 0.955 |
| ETH | signed order flow | 0.0013 | 0.0020 | −0.78 | 0.766 |
| SOL | open interest | 0.0024 | 0.0020 | 0.35 | 0.294 |

Every observed value sits inside its own permutation null — several are
*below* the mean of 200 random shuffles. No detectable directional information
flow from either source into price direction, on this data, at this sample
size. (The self-referential control also showed nothing above null, consistent
with Part I's near-zero return autocorrelation — there was no strong known
signal available here to calibrate against, which is itself informative about
how little structure exists in this series at 15-minute resolution.)

## What this round adds to the picture

None of the three is a retail indicator. All three are legitimate, named
results from finance and information theory, computed correctly, tested with
the same four gates as everything else, and none found anything that survives.

That is now five structurally different attempts at the same question — price
transforms (Part VI), microstructure impact, jump/diffusion decomposition,
information-theoretic transfer, and (Part IV/V) the entry/exit/holding-period
grid — agreeing from five different angles. It doesn't prove no equation could
ever work. It does mean the ones a working researcher would reach for first
have now been tried, correctly, and came back empty on the data actually
available.

The honest limits stand exactly as in Part VI: Kyle's lambda and transfer
entropy are tied to the 30-day derivatives window and would deserve a real
retest on years of open-interest/funding history; the jump/diffusion result is
now well-powered and is a clean negative, not an inconclusive one.

# Part VIII — Three new constructs, exactly 30 minutes, four coins together

Two direct requests: commit to a fixed 30-minute forecast horizon instead of
instant exits, and use four coins' data together rather than one at a time,
testing constructs invented for this rather than reused from anywhere else.

```bash
node research/fetch-klines.js DOGEUSDT 15 40000     # 4th coin, same depth as BTC/ETH/SOL
node research/creative-equations.js --cost 4
```

On the 30-minute question directly: Part VI already fit a combined
price+derivatives model at exactly this horizon (2 bars) and found IC between
−0.052 and +0.030 — indistinguishable from zero. This round does not repeat
that model; it tests three constructs that were never tried in any form.

## 1. Market Gravity

Retail volume-profile tools weight nearby volume nodes roughly linearly. This
applies Newton's inverse-square law instead — literally F = mass / distance² —
treating each historical volume node as a mass and current price as a test
particle, summing the signed pull from every node within range. The
inverse-square kernel is a specific, physically-motivated choice nothing in
Part VI or any indicator library makes.

| symbol | lookback | n | mean bps | t(HAC) | 1st half | 2nd half |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BTC | 40 | 8,012 | −3.80 | **−11.04** | −3.9 | −3.7 |
| ETH | 40 | 8,011 | −4.45 | **−8.81** | −5.4 | −3.6 |
| SOL | 96 | 8,000 | −4.97 | **−9.09** | −5.1 | −4.9 |
| DOGE | 40 | 8,011 | −3.51 | **−6.08** | −3.8 | −3.2 |

Overwhelmingly significant, negative, stable across both halves, and stable
across four unrelated coins. Betting price moves toward the strongest
inverse-square pull loses reliably.

## 2. Permutation Entropy regime filter

A genuine result from nonlinear dynamics (Bandt & Pompe, 2002), not finance:
measures how *ordered* the sequence of recent moves is via the diversity of
their ordinal patterns, independent of size or direction. This operationalises
the "five well-calculated trades" instinct precisely, as a testable selection
filter rather than a feeling: does a simple reversion signal work specifically
in the rare windows where price is behaving unusually non-randomly, even though
Part IV/VI showed it does not work on average?

| symbol | entropy band | n | mean bps | t(HAC) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BTC | lowest 20% (ordered) | 8,025 | **−4.39** | −10.52 |
| BTC | all bars (baseline) | 40,033 | −3.84 | −20.73 |
| ETH | lowest 20% (ordered) | 8,166 | **−5.49** | −9.03 |
| ETH | all bars (baseline) | 40,018 | −4.31 | −16.06 |

The ordered-regime filter does not beat the unfiltered baseline anywhere — on
BTC and ETH it is slightly *worse*. Restricting to the moments where the path
looks most non-random does not surface a better subset of trades. The
selectivity instinct was reasonable; this is a real test of it, and it says no.

## 3. Cross-Asset Dispersion Rank

The one construct here that structurally cannot be computed from a single
coin's data: at every bar, each coin's trailing return is z-scored against the
*other three* coins at that same instant, and the test is whether being the
basket's extreme outlier — laggard or leader relative to normally-correlated
peers — predicts snapping back toward the group.

(First pass had a bug worth naming: the z-score included the coin's own value
in the sample it was scored against, which mathematically bounds the maximum
achievable z-score with only 4 points and starved the test of the exact
extreme events it needed. Fixed to score strictly against the other three.)

| symbol | extreme | n | mean bps | t(HAC) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BTC | laggard (z<−1.5) | 1,544 | −5.00 | −5.28 |
| ETH | leader (z>1.5) | 4,011 | −4.89 | −5.61 |
| DOGE | laggard (z<−1.5) | 9,838 | −4.76 | −5.86 |

Same pattern. An outlier coin does not reliably snap back toward its peers at
this horizon.

## The result

**28 of 28 tests survive FDR correction. Zero are positive and stable across
both halves.** Every one of the three constructs, on every one of the four
coins, at exactly the 30-minute horizon asked for.

The one thing worth pointing out about this round specifically: the negative
means cluster remarkably tightly, −2 to −5 bps, across three unrelated
constructs and four unrelated assets. Pure noise would not do that — it would
scatter both in sign and in magnitude. This tight, one-sided clustering is
itself the signature of a real, near-zero gross edge being consistently
overwhelmed by the same few basis points of cost, which is the exact finding
of every part of this research from Part I onward, arrived at again from three
constructs invented specifically to be unlike anything already tried.

## Where the honest boundary is now

Eight structurally different approaches agree: price transforms (VI),
microstructure impact (VII), jump/diffusion decomposition (VII), information-
theoretic transfer (VII), the full entry/exit/hold grid (IV/V), and now
inverse-square volume gravity, ordinal-pattern entropy, and cross-sectional
dispersion (VIII). None of this proves no equation could work. It means the
mathematics genuinely worth trying — reused from finance, physics, and
information theory, and three built fresh for this — has been tried, correctly,
on the data actually available, at the exact horizon asked for, using all four
coins together where that was the point, and none of it clears its own cost.

What remains untried is not a smarter equation on this data. It is data this
project has not yet been able to reach: the order-book collector
(`collect-orderbook.js`) needs weeks of runtime it has not had, and every
derivatives-based construct here is still bounded by OKX's 30-day retention.
Those are the two honest places left to look.

# Part IX — What is the best this project can get, combined?

Every prior part tested *whether* a signal exists. This part asks a different
question: given the one lever that has ever moved net expectancy (execution
cost — Part V) and the one structural layer that ever showed a positive,
if noisy, number (the seven-analyst swarm's advisory gating — Part III), what
does the V3 engine actually produce if both are pushed together, end to end,
on the full 418-day / four-symbol backtest?

This grid was run twice. The first pass was reported to the user verbally,
from memory, as "roughly breakeven to +0.05R" for the disabled-swarm case and
"an erratic +0.44R at n=50" for advisory mode. That recollection undersold the
disabled-swarm case and used a stale number for advisory mode. The table below
is the actual second run, saved to JSON so it can be checked rather than
recalled — `swarmMode off|advisory`, `--exec maker`, offset swept 0-30bps,
`--makerTimeout 20`, full 418-day backtest, `--seed 1` (meta-learner seeded
from Part III's study):

| swarmMode | offset | n | win rate | expectancy (R) | total R | profit factor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| off | 0bps | 320 | 49.1% | −0.009 | −2.99 | 0.98 |

| advisory | 20bps | 83 | 55.4% | +0.215 | +17.84 | 1.45 |
| advisory | 30bps | 76 | 56.6% | **+0.791** | +60.08 | 2.79 |

For reference, the original V2 baseline on the identical data is a constant
n=1,638, win rate 42.6%, expectancy **−0.174R**, total −284R — every row above
already beats it by a wide margin.

**Two different things are happening in this table, and they should not be
read as the same finding:**

1. **The `off`-mode column is the trustworthy one.** Win rate and n move
   smoothly and monotonically as offset rises — n falls only 10% (320→287)
   while expectancy rises steadily. This is patient limit entry doing exactly
   what Part V already proved it does: saving the spread/fee on every trade
   that fills, with no change to trade *selection* (win rate is flat at
   47-49% throughout, exactly Part V's finding that gross edge never moves).
   +0.155R to +0.288R at 20-30bps offset, on 300+ trades, is a real, stable
   number given everything this project has verified about the mechanism
   producing it.

2. **The `advisory`-mode column is not trustworthy at face value**, and this
   needs to be said plainly rather than quoted as a headline number. n
   collapses to 76-94 — the swarm's gating rejects roughly 70% of the setups
   `off` mode takes — and the expectancy figures are noisy and non-monotonic
   in a way `off` mode's are not (57.8%→56.3%→57.1% win rate has no trend).
   The advisory@30bps cell (+0.791R, n=76) is the largest number in the whole
   table and the least trustworthy one in it: at n=76 a handful of large
   winners can move expectancy by tenths of an R, and the analyst-reliability
   diagnostic printed with every one of these runs says so directly — every
   analyst in every regime is still below the ~15-observation floor the
   meta-learner itself uses before it will trust a reliability weight (see
   the per-run tables: RANGE/volumeProfile n=23-31, RANGE/liquidity n=24-28,
   TREND/liquidity n=17-19, RANGE/traps n=11-13, across all six advisory
   runs). The swarm is gating trades on weights the project's own code
   considers statistically premature. This isn't a new finding — Part III
   already reported the swarm's measured impact as "mostly negative/neutral"
   — but this grid shows specifically *why* the occasional positive advisory
   number should not be banked on: it's a small, cherry-pickable sample
   riding on unvalidated weights, not a stable effect the way the `off`-mode
   trend is.

**The honest combined ceiling, stated once and precisely:** with the swarm
left in an advisory role turned **off** and execution moved to a 20-30bps
patient maker offset, this project's full pipeline — four coins, 418 days,
real fee and slippage costs, the corrected intrabar stop-check logic from
Part I, every validated finding from Parts I-VIII folded in as "things not to
bother retesting" — produces **+0.155R to +0.288R average expectancy over
287-300 trades**, a profit factor of 1.38-1.70, entirely attributable to
paying less to enter and exit, not to predicting direction. Turning the
swarm's advisory gating on does not add a validated increment on top of that;
it produces a much smaller, noisier sample whose best cell looks better only
because it is the easiest of twelve numbers to have happened by chance.

# Part X — Re-testing an external formula report, and the candle/liquidation
# indicator family

Two things arrived from outside this project's own research: a user-supplied
report of 192 tests of 16 tanh-wrapped formulas (F1-F8 on price/volume/
volatility, A-H adding OKX derivatives) against a barrier-race event (does
price hit +0.5% before -0.5% within a horizon of 2/4/8/16 bars on 15m data),
and a proposed five-indicator family (Forced-Flow Absorption Residual, Candle
Rejection w/ Volume, Liquidation Concentration Shock, Cross-Asset Stress
Breadth, Trend Efficiency & Fragility) built against a liquidation+OHLCV
dataset bundle. Both were re-implemented and tested with this project's full
discipline — plus two checks specific to a barrier-race structure that a
naive read of "win rate" would get wrong: causal (expanding-window) decile
thresholds instead of a fixed cutoff that could leak the future, and a
moving-block bootstrap instead of a binomial test, because a horizon-race
outcome sampled every bar is exactly the kind of heavily-overlapping series
that inflated 18 anomalies to false significance back in Part II.

**Two rounds were needed to trust the result.** The first implementation had
a real performance bug — the causal decile threshold re-sorted the entire
"seen so far" history array at *every single bar*, which is O(n² log n) over
a ~40,000-bar series. Neither script finished; one ran 1h43m, the other
1h14m, both killed and fixed (refresh the sorted threshold every 200 bars
instead of every bar — still strictly causal, just not re-derived 40,000
times). Independently checking the first successful run then turned up a
second bug: the split-half stability check only ever computed the long
tail's first-half/second-half win rate, so a short-tail survivor's
"stability" was silently checked against the wrong tail's numbers entirely.
Both are fixed; the numbers below are from the corrected re-run.

## The liquidation-dependent indicators: untestable, and said so up front

Before testing anything against it, the liquidation feed was audited: OKX's
public liquidation-orders endpoint returns only its ~100 most recent records
per instrument — in this fetch, 100 events spanning 3-7 hours per coin.
Re-fetching gets a different recent 100, never a longer history. That is
far below this project's n≥300 floor for any HAC/FDR test, so Forced-Flow
Absorption Residual, Liquidation Concentration Shock, and Cross-Asset Stress
Breadth are reported only as descriptive snapshots of that one ~3-7h window
per coin (BTC/ETH/SOL all showed heavy net forced *selling*, F=−0.87 to
−0.99, in their respective captured windows) — not as tested hypotheses.
Dressing an n=100-over-a-few-hours sample up with a t-statistic would repeat
exactly the small-sample mistake this project's own Part II caught once
already.

## Candle Rejection & Trend Efficiency/Fragility: zero survive (again)

The two indicators that need only OHLCV — which this project has at 418
days depth for four coins — got the full test at all four requested
horizons (15min/30min/1h/1day). **0 of 224 tests (7 signal variants × 4
coins × 4 horizons × 2 tails) survive FDR.** Same pattern as every prior
part of this project.

## The formula report: the first result in this entire project to survive everything

This is different. **8 of the price formulas (F1_NonlinearPressure,
F3_TrendEfficiency, F6_Interaction, F7_Asymmetry, F8_MultiScale) show a
55-57% win rate at the 30-minute-to-1-hour horizon on BTC and ETH, stable in
sign across both halves of samples of 1,200-3,000 trades, surviving FDR
across 448 tests at p≈0.003-0.02.** That is a real, positive, HAC-equivalent-
significant, split-sample-stable, cost-floor-clearing result — the first
thing in sixteen studies (price transforms, microstructure impact, jump/
diffusion, transfer entropy, market gravity, permutation entropy, cross-
asset dispersion, the full entry/exit/hold grid, candle rejection, trend
fragility) to clear every one of this project's own gates simultaneously.

It needs three honest qualifications, not a headline without them:

1. **Effective rank of the 8 price formulas is 2.44 out of 8** — the same
   check Part VI ran on RSI/ROC/Bollinger etc. This is one real thing (short-
   horizon trend/momentum efficiency, expressed via a symmetric barrier
   instead of a hold-to-close return) restated in five slightly different
   linear combinations, not five independent discoveries.
2. **It is cost-fragile.** Converting each survivor's win rate to a
   breakeven round-trip cost (2×WR−1, in the 50bps-wide barrier's own units)
   gives 4.0-7.2bps for every price-formula survivor. This project's own
   Part I/V found realistic taker cost around 13-17bps and patient-maker
   execution reaching breakeven only around 0-10bps depending on offset —
   so this edge lives right at the boundary of what the best execution this
   project has demonstrated can reach, not comfortably inside it.
3. **The effect decays with horizon** — 26 of 56 long-tail tests clear
   WR>53% at h=2 (30min), falling to 18/56 by h=16 (4h) — consistent with a
   real but short-lived momentum-continuation effect, which is a sensible
   thing to find, not a red flag by itself, but it means this is not a
   "hold it and forget it" edge.

**The derivatives-formula results (D_RegimeWeighted, F_CrossPressure,
C_LiquidityCascade, A_ConvexFlow at 60-69% win rate, breakeven costs 10-19bps
— on paper the most attractive numbers in this entire project) get a fourth,
more serious qualification: every one of them is drawn from the same single
~33-day window** (2026-08-09 to 2026-09-11 — OKX's derivatives history
retention limit, the same ceiling noted throughout this project). Four
different formulas "confirming" a pattern inside one continuous 33-day
market episode is much weaker evidence than four independent months would
be — it is one regime, not four. This project has already watched exactly
this shape of finding (strong, clean, and confined to one narrow window)
evaporate once, in the cross-venue and seasonality studies' own early,
self-corrected mistakes. The derivatives numbers are worth re-checking
against a second independent window before being trusted at the same level
as the price-only result; they are not there yet.

## Where this leaves the project

The price-formula finding is real by every gate this project uses, and it is
the first one. It is also thin — a few basis points of edge that patient
execution can only just clear, decaying with horizon, and built from what
is effectively one underlying signal wearing five names. It belongs
alongside Part IX's finding, not above it: the swarm-off / patient-maker
ceiling of +0.155R to +0.288R remains the larger, better-established number,
built on 418 days and hundreds of trades rather than a symmetric barrier's
more forgiving payoff structure. Whether the two combine — patient entry
timed specifically around an F3/F8/F1-style trend-efficiency signal, tested
on this project's own asymmetric hold-to-close structure rather than the
report's barrier race — is the one genuinely new thing this round surfaced
that has not been tried yet.

# Part XI — Upgrading the surviving formula: what actually raises win rate

Asked directly: can the Part X survivor family be pushed to a higher win
rate? Four specific, testable ideas, not "tune it until it looks better" —
run on BTC/ETH at h=2 (30min), same discipline as Study 15 (causal decile
thresholds, block-bootstrap significance, split-half, FDR, cost-adjusted
breakeven):

1. **Ensemble** — average the five correlated formulas (F1, F3, F6, F7, F8)
   into one score, instead of using the single best (F3_TrendEfficiency)
   alone.
2. **Tighter percentile** — does the most extreme 5% or 2% of readings beat
   the top 10%, as a real monotonic signal should?
3. **Conviction** — require k-of-5 formulas to simultaneously sit in their
   own individual top decile at once.
4. **Regime filter** — split the F3 top-decile signal by whether the
   trend-efficiency feature itself is in a high or low regime.

**The ensemble is the one that actually works, consistently.** Averaging the
five formulas beats the single-best formula on *both* coins at *both*
thresholds where it was tested:

| coin | test | n | win rate | vs. F3-alone baseline | breakeven cost | split |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BTC | F3 alone, top10% (baseline) | 1298 | 57.2% | — | 7.2bps | 59%/56% |
| BTC | Ensemble, top10% | 864 | 58.9% | **+1.7pp** | 8.9bps | 56%/62% |
| BTC | Ensemble, top5% | 579 | 59.1% | **+1.9pp** | 9.1bps | 59%/59% |
| ETH | F3 alone, top10% (baseline) | 1873 | 54.8% | — | 4.8bps | 56%/54% |
| ETH | Ensemble, top10% | 1544 | 56.3% | **+1.5pp** | 6.3bps | 55%/57% |
| ETH | Ensemble, top5% | 931 | 56.1% | **+1.2pp** | 6.1bps | 55%/57% |

That's a real, mechanism-explainable improvement, not noise: five correlated
but not identical measurements of the same underlying short-horizon trend-
efficiency signal, averaged, cancel some of each other's idiosyncratic
noise — the textbook reason ensembling helps. It raises the breakeven cost
this edge needs to clear from 4.8-7.2bps to 6.1-9.1bps, which matters
concretely: Part V/IX found patient maker execution reaching breakeven
around 0-10bps depending on offset, so the ensemble version sits more
comfortably inside what this project has actually demonstrated it can
execute at, rather than right on the boundary.

**The other three ideas did not hold up as cleanly:**

- *Tighter percentile alone* (without ensembling) is not monotonic — BTC's
  top5% (55.8%) is actually *worse* than its top10% (57.2%); ETH's top5%
  (54.3%) is worse than its top10% (54.8%). A real signal sharpening under
  extremity would show a clean rise; this doesn't, which argues the single-
  formula tails contain real noise, not just a purer version of the signal.
- *Conviction (k-of-5 agreement)* helped on BTC at k≥4 (+0.9pp) but was flat
  or negative on ETH at the same threshold, and the strictest version
  (5-of-5, n=217-294) flipped direction between coins entirely (BTC −1.9pp,
  ETH +1.6pp) — exactly the small-sample inconsistency this project treats
  as a warning sign, not a result.
- *The regime filter* moved win rate by only 0.3-1.4pp and only on BTC's
  high-efficiency half; ETH barely moved at all.

**The honest upgrade, stated once:** ensembling the five formulas — not
picking a cleverer one, not trading less often on a stricter cutoff, not
requiring unanimous agreement — is the one change here with a mechanism, a
consistent direction across both coins tested, and a stable split-sample
sign. It moves win rate from ~55-57% to ~56-59% and roughly doubles the
margin over realistic execution cost. It does not change the underlying
finding's nature: it is still one short-horizon trend-efficiency signal, now
measured slightly better.

# Part XII — New features on top of the ensemble

Four candidates, each adding information the ensemble does not already use
(not just re-slicing m4/m16/vz/eff again): volume confirmation, cross-asset
agreement (does ETH's ensemble agreeing with BTC's, at the same timestamp,
raise BTC's win rate — real new information, since it can't be derived from
BTC's own price series), signal persistence (has the ensemble been in its
own top decile for ≥2 consecutive bars, vs. just crossing in this bar), and
session timing (Asia/Europe/US UTC blocks).

**Signal persistence is the one that holds up on both coins:**

| coin | test | n | win rate | vs. baseline | split |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BTC | Ensemble top10% (baseline) | 864 | 58.9% | — | 56%/62% |
| BTC | AND sustained ≥2 consecutive bars | 243 | 61.3% | **+2.4pp** | 60%/62% |
| ETH | Ensemble top10% (baseline) | 1544 | 56.3% | — | 55%/57% |
| ETH | AND sustained ≥2 consecutive bars | 450 | 57.1% | **+0.8pp** | 57%/57% |

Consistent direction on both coins, both with tight, stable split-halves,
and a real mechanism: a signal that has stayed elevated for more than one
bar is less likely to be a single noisy spike and more likely reflects
sustained conviction. The cost is trade count — this filters out roughly
70-72% of the baseline's trades, so it trades much less often in exchange
for a meaningfully higher win rate on what's left (breakeven cost rises to
11.3bps on BTC).

**Volume confirmation and cross-asset agreement added nothing.** Gating on
elevated volume (vz>0) moved win rate by less than half a point either way
on both coins — unsurprising, since vz is already an ingredient inside four
of the five ensemble formulas, so this "new" gate wasn't actually new
information. BTC's win rate barely moved (−0.3pp, n=852 — 99% of the
baseline's trades) when requiring ETH's ensemble to simultaneously agree,
meaning the two coins' signals are usually already pointing the same way at
the same time and the gate filters almost nothing.

**Session timing is a genuine "interesting, not yet trustworthy" lead.**
Both coins were *worse* in the US session (16-24 UTC: BTC −4.8pp, ETH
−2.0pp) — a directionally consistent result worth noting. But their best
sessions disagreed (BTC liked Asia, +3.8pp; ETH liked Europe, +1.2pp), six
session/coin combinations were tested here (more multiple-testing exposure
than the other three ideas combined), and BTC's worst cell (US session)
has a first-half win rate of exactly 50% — a flip risk sitting right at the
edge, not a stable pattern. This needs a longer, purpose-built session
study (more coins, explicit FDR across all 24 individual hours rather than
3 wide blocks) before being trusted as more than a lead.

**The honest combined picture:** persistence is a real, validated upgrade —
trade less often, win more when you do. Volume and cross-asset gates are
dead ends here specifically because the ensemble already captures what
they'd add. Session timing deserves a dedicated follow-up, not a verdict
yet.

# Part XIII — Does it generalize across the whole market?

Every survivor so far held on only 2 of 4-6 coins (BTC, ETH). This runs the
exact same, already-frozen ensemble+persistence formula from Parts XI/XII —
no new tuning — against 28 more liquid USDT perpetuals (majors, L1s, L2s,
DeFi names, memecoins; ~84 days of 15m history each, fetched fresh from OKX
for this test), to ask directly: is this a market-wide phenomenon, or were
BTC/ETH a fluke?

**A data mistake happened while fetching this set, disclosed here because
it affects how one number below should be read.** Re-running
`fetch-klines.js` for BTC/ETH/SOL/DOGE/AVAX/LINK at a shallower depth
(sized for the new 84-day fetch) silently replaced their existing 418-day
cached history — the script merged across different intervals but not
within the same interval, so a shallower re-fetch overwrote deeper history
instead of extending it. Fixed (union old+new rows before deduping,
history can now only grow) and the 418-day depth is being restored for
those 6 coins in the background. Until that finishes, **BTC's number in
this Part is measured on a recent 84-day window, not the 418-day series
Part X/XI/XII used** — it is not a like-for-like replication and is
flagged everywhere it appears below.

## The answer: no, it does not generalize

| | result |
|---|---|
| Coins clearing WR>52% | 13 of 28 |
| ...and also split-half stable | 12 of 28 |
| Coins surviving FDR (q=0.10) across all 28 | **1 (BTC only)** |
| Split-half sign flips | 10 of 28 — roughly a third |
| **Pooled test (all 28 coins' top-decile trades combined)** | **n=12,053, WR=51.46%, p=0.24 — not significant** |

The pooled test is the cleanest single answer, and it is decisive: combining
every coin's trades into one sample — the honest way to ask "is there a
market-wide edge" instead of eyeballing which individual coins happened to
clear 52% — gives a win rate barely above a coin flip with a p-value of
0.24. That is indistinguishable from noise. A third of the 28 coins flip
sign between the first and second half of their own sample, which is
exactly what pure noise scattered around 50% produces, not what a real,
shared signal would do.

BTC (67.7% WR, n=167, the sole FDR survivor here) is the one exception —
but on the *84-day* window this fetch used, not the 418-day one Part XI/XII
measured 57.2-58.9% on. A win rate that jumps from ~58% to ~68% when the
window shrinks from 418 days to 84 is itself a warning sign this project
has flagged before (Part X's single-33-day-window derivatives caveat,
almost verbatim): it means this particular 84-day stretch was unusually
favorable for BTC specifically, not that BTC is uniquely 68%-predictable.
ETH's number here (57.3%, n=293) sits close enough to Part XI's original
54.8-56.3% to look like a genuine, if modest, replication rather than
window-selection luck — but it, too, is on the shorter window and will be
re-checked once the 418-day restore finishes.

The persistence filter, applied across the same 28 coins, does not rescue
this: BTC again leads (68.5%, but n collapses to 54 trades on the short
window), a handful of coins (SOL, XRP, LINK, FIL) show a modest positive
tilt, but 11 of 28 flip sign and the overall pattern is the same scatter,
not a market-wide effect.

## What this means for the project's central finding

Part XI/XII's result is not overturned — BTC and ETH's numbers on their own
418-day series still stand as measured, and ETH's rough replication here is
a mildly encouraging sign. But "the whole crypto market" was the right
question to ask, and the honest answer is that this specific short-horizon
trend-efficiency signal is not a market-wide phenomenon. It is, at most, a
BTC/ETH-specific (large-cap, deep-liquidity) effect, and even that should
now be held with slightly less confidence than before this test, precisely
because the one thing that would have made it more convincing — the same
edge showing up broadly across many coins — did not happen. A pending
follow-up re-checks BTC/ETH once the accidentally-shortened cache is
restored to its original 418-day depth, to settle whether the numbers in
Part XI/XII still hold exactly, or shift now that a few more weeks of data
sit at the end of the series.

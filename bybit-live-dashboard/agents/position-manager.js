/**
 * DIV-12 — Position Manager (replaces the old "Position Guardian").
 *
 * THE DIAGNOSIS
 * The previous guardian ran inside renderPositionGuardian() on a 3-second
 * timer, and market-closed a position the moment ANY of three things was true:
 *   - the live engine's decision for that symbol had flipped to the other side,
 *   - the whale tracker's dominant side had flipped,
 *   - the trap guard had tripped.
 *
 * All three flip constantly. The engine re-derived its decision every 3 seconds
 * from 1-minute data; the whale side flips on a single $50k print inside a
 * 5-minute window. So the practical behaviour was: enter, and at the first
 * adverse wiggle — usually within a minute or two, and usually the ordinary
 * retrace that happens right after any entry — close at market for a small
 * loss, pay the taker fee and the spread, and repeat. That is precisely the
 * "it always cuts out when it's turning red" symptom, and it is also why it
 * never held a winner: a thesis flicker closed profitable positions on exactly
 * the same trigger.
 *
 * Worse, the exit was unconditional on P&L, so a trade that was +2R could be
 * closed by a 3-second blip in whale side.
 *
 * THE REPLACEMENT
 * A position can only be exited by one of a small number of *named, structural*
 * events. Everything else is noise and is explicitly ignored:
 *
 *   1. STOP    — the broker-side stop loss, set at entry, is the hard boundary.
 *   2. TARGET  — scale-outs at TP1/TP2/TP3.
 *   3. STRUCTURE_BROKEN — a CONFIRMED candle closes beyond the invalidation
 *                level the setup was built on. Not a tick through it: a close.
 *   4. THESIS_FLIP — an opposing signal of grade A or better, persisting across
 *                N consecutive evaluations, AND the position is not in profit.
 *   5. TIME_STOP — the idea has had its allotted bars and has gone nowhere.
 *                Freeing dead risk is a good cut; cutting a working trade is not.
 *   6. EMERGENCY — data invalid, spread blowout, feed halt.
 *
 * Plus two rules that protect winners rather than culling them:
 *   - a grace period after entry during which only the hard stop applies;
 *   - once TP1 is banked the stop moves to break-even, and after TP2 it trails
 *     the structure, so "turning red" on an open winner becomes impossible by
 *     construction rather than by reflex.
